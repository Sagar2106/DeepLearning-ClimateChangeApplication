# DeepLearning-ClimateChangeApplication
A suite using various deep learning technologies for Climate Change.
Goal: To spread Climate Change awareness using Deep Learning to predict future data to show the alarming rate at which climate change is impacting the planet earth. 
Graphs are a good visual aid measure to depict the climate change which would further advance our goal. 

**Data:**
The original datasets were obtained from Kaggle and we performed some data cleaning on the data which is why we have attached the Data Files. 

**Steps to run:**
1. Please download the data files and upload them onto your google drive
2. Download the jupyter notebook files from code and open them with colab.
3. Update the path in the code with your new data path. 
4. select 'Run All' to see the results. 

**Files:**
1. Code Folder - has code files for Prophet, GRU and LSTM for 3 datasets
2. Data Folder - 3 datasets have been added
3. Output Folder - output CSV files generated by each model. 
4. Report - Final Report
